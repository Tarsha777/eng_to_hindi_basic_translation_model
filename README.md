# English to Hindi Translation Model

This project implements a basic English-to-Hindi translation model using a sequence-to-sequence architecture with an attention mechanism. It is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how natural language translation can be done using deep learning techniques.

## ðŸš€ Features

- English to Hindi translation using deep learning.
- Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Utilizes Seq2Seq model with LSTM layers.
- Includes attention mechanism for better context understanding.
- Trained on a parallel corpus of English-Hindi sentence pairs.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: Embedding + LSTM
- **Decoder**: Embedding + LSTM + Attention + Dense layer
- **Attention Mechanism**: Bahdanau Attention
